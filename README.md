# Game of NIM

## How to play the game: 
<p> The game of NIM is a simple game. It starts with 6 and 8 bisuicts in 2 piles. 
  The players will then take turns to remove any number of biscuits from each pile, but they can only remove an equal number from both piles. 
  The aim is to get the last biscuit.

## Features implemented in the program:

<p>
  The game is designed to be played in the terminal/console by the 2 players. 
   I have implemented simple features like: 
  
     Validating the number of biscuits the player takes doesn't exceed the numbeer available
     Verifying the player can only pick from pile 1 or 2 (no other input would be valid)
